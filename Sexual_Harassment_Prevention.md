## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any behaviour that is **unwelcome**, **sexual in nature**, and makes someone feel **uncomfortable, unsafe, or disrespected**. It can be verbal, non-verbal, physical, or involve misuse of power.

###  Verbal Behaviour
- Making sexual jokes, comments, or remarks.
- Repeatedly asking someone out after they said "no".
- Talking about someone’s body or appearance in an inappropriate way.
- Spreading rumours about someone’s sexual life or relationship.

###  Non-Verbal Behaviour
- Staring or leering at someone.
- Sending sexually suggestive texts, emojis, images, or videos.
- Making inappropriate gestures or facial expressions.
- Displaying offensive posters, screensavers, or content at work.

###  Physical Behaviour
- Touching, brushing, or patting someone without their permission.
- Standing too close or blocking someone’s way.
- Hugging, kissing, or trying to touch someone when they are not okay with it.

###  Power-Based Harassment
- Offering job benefits (like promotion or raise) in exchange for sexual favours.
- Threatening or punishing someone for rejecting sexual advances.
- Misusing authority to create a hostile or uncomfortable work environment.

> Even if someone says “I was just joking” – if the other person feels uncomfortable, it is considered harassment.


##  2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

###  If I Face Sexual Harassment
1. **Stay Calm and Safe** – If possible, move away from the person or place.
2. **Say “No” Firmly** – Let the person know their behaviour is not acceptable.
3. **Document Everything** – Note the date, time, place, what happened, and who saw it.
4. **Report It** – Inform HR or the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) as per the MountBlue PoSH policy.
5. **Ask for Support** – Speak to a colleague, friend, or family member.
6. **Follow Up** – Check that appropriate action is being taken.

###  If I Witness Sexual Harassment
- **Support the Victim** – Ask if they are okay and encourage them to report it.
- **Speak Up if Safe** – Let the person know their behaviour is wrong.
- **Report the Incident** – As a witness, I can and should report the issue.
- **Avoid Encouraging It** – Do not laugh, join in, or ignore the situation.



##  Key Points to Remember
- Complaints are **kept confidential**.
- No one will be punished for reporting (this is called **non-retaliation**).
- Every employee has the **right to a safe, respectful workplace**.
- The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is there to help.
