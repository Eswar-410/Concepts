# Listening and Communication

### 1. What are the steps to do Active Listening?

- I look at the person when they talk.
- I don’t talk while they are speaking.
- I try to understand their words and feelings.
- I show I’m listening by nodding or smiling.
- I repeat what they said in my own words.
- I ask questions if I don’t understand.

### 2. What is Reflective Listening?

Reflective Listening means I try to really understand what the other person is saying and feeling. I listen carefully and then say back what I heard in a simple way to make sure I got it right. I pay attention to their body language and tone to understand their feelings better. I show that I care about their message by being calm and respectful. I do not judge them, and I try to make them feel safe and heard.

### 3. What stops me from listening well?

Sometimes I get distracted by my phone or noises around me. I also notice that I think about what I want to say next instead of fully listening to the person. There are times when I don’t pay full attention because I am tired or my mind is somewhere else. I also tend to talk too early and cut people off before they finish. Sometimes, I guess what they mean instead of asking for more information, which makes me miss the full message.

### 4. How can I become a better listener?

To be a better listener, I will put away my phone and other distractions when someone is talking to me. I will try harder to stay focused and really think about what they are saying. I will write down important points if needed so I don’t forget. I will wait patiently until the person finishes before I speak. If I don’t understand something, I will ask questions to clarify. I want to practice these habits every day to improve.

### 5. When do I use Passive Communication?

I use passive communication when I feel shy or scared to speak up. Sometimes I avoid arguments because I don’t want to cause problems. When I am not sure what to say or how to say it, I stay quiet. Often, I let others make decisions because I do not want to upset anyone or cause conflict.

### 6. When do I use Aggressive Communication?

I speak in an aggressive way when I feel very angry or frustrated. If I think people are not listening or respecting me, I become forceful. When I want things to happen quickly and feel stressed, I react without thinking carefully. In these moments, I sometimes speak too loudly or harshly.

### 7. When do I use Passive Aggressive Communication?

I use passive-aggressive communication when I feel upset but don’t say it clearly to the person. Instead, I might use sarcasm or make jokes that hurt feelings. Sometimes I stop talking to someone on purpose to show I’m angry. I also complain to others about someone instead of talking directly to them.

### 8. How can I speak in an Assertive way?

To speak assertively, I try to say what I feel in a kind and clear way. I use sentences like “I feel…” or “I think…” to express myself without blaming others. I stay calm and polite, even if I don’t agree with someone. I listen to what others say before I respond. When I need to say no, I do it respectfully without feeling guilty. Being assertive means I am honest and respectful at the same time.
