# Learning Process
## Question 1  
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

So there’s this technique called the Feynman Technique — named after a super smart physicist, Richard Feynman. The idea is pretty simple: if you want to understand something well, try to explain it like you’re teaching a child or a friend who knows nothing about it. If you can explain it in super simple language, that means you actually get it. But if you struggle, that’s your clue to go back and study more. Basically, it’s like testing your understanding by teaching.

## Question 2  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  

What really caught my attention in this talk was Barbara Oakley’s story about how she used to be terrible at math. She literally ran away from it as a kid! But later on, she figured out how to study better and trained her brain — and now she teaches engineering. That’s amazing. It shows that learning is a skill, not just a talent you're born with. Her journey felt real and motivating, especially for someone like me who sometimes doubts if I can learn tough stuff. She made it feel possible.

## Question 3  
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

Barbara also talked about how our brains have two different modes of thinking — active and diffused.

- **Active mode** is when you’re fully focused. Like when you're trying to solve a math problem or learn something new. You’re putting in effort and paying full attention.  
- **Diffused mode** is more relaxed. It’s like when you’re walking, daydreaming, or just chilling. You’re not thinking hard, but your brain is still working in the background, connecting ideas.

What’s cool is that we need both. You learn something in active mode, and then your brain makes deeper connections in diffused mode. So breaks are not a waste — they actually help you learn better.

## Question 4  
**According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**

This video gave a really simple way to start learning anything new without getting overwhelmed. These are the 4 steps he shared:

1. **Deconstruct the skill** – Break the topic into smaller parts, don’t try to learn everything at once.  
2. **Learn enough to self-correct** – Learn just enough to start doing it and notice your mistakes.  
3. **Remove practice barriers** – Cut out distractions (like phones or noisy places) so you can focus.  
4. **Practice at least 20 hours** – It doesn’t take years — if you put in 20 good hours, you’ll be surprisingly good.

## Question 5  
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

Here’s what I think I can start doing to learn better and faster:

- First, I should really start using the **Feynman Technique**. After I learn something, I’ll try to explain it out loud like I’m teaching a friend. That should help me figure out if I actually understand it or not.
- I also want to **use both active and diffused modes**. So I’ll give myself short breaks while studying, instead of sitting for hours straight. That way, my brain can relax and still work in the background.
- Distractions are a big problem, so I’ll **keep my phone on silent** and remove unnecessary notifications — especially when I’m working. I might even use an app to block social media during work time.
- I’m going to **track my time using apps like Boosted**, so I know where my time goes and how focused I really am.
- I’ll ask myself questions like: *Where is this concept used? Can I explain it in my own words? Can I write code for it?*  
- I’ll also set simple deadlines, not to rush, but to help me plan and stay on track.  
- And most importantly — I’ll try to **enjoy learning**, not treat it like a burden. If I can make it fun and personal, I’ll remember it better.
- Finally, I’ll remind myself that I don’t need to know *everything* — but if I get really good at a few key things, that can take me far.
