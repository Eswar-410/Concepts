# Grit and Growth Mindset

 ## 1. Grit

- The speaker says that success is not just about being smart or talented. It’s about having grit, which means working hard, staying strong during hard times, and not giving up easily. People who keep trying even when things are difficult are more likely to succeed in school, jobs, and life. Grit helps you stay focused on your goals for a long time.

## 2. Introduction to Growth Mindset

- The video explains that a growth mindset means believing you can learn and get better through effort and practice. A fixed mindset is when people think their skills cannot change. With a growth mindset, people are not afraid of mistakes, they try harder, and they enjoy learning. It helps you become better in school, sports, and anything you do in life.

## 3. Understanding Internal Locus of Control

- Internal locus of control means you believe your choices and actions shape your life. If something goes wrong, you try to fix it instead of blaming others. The video says people with this mindset are more confident, responsible, and do better in life because they believe they have control. They also work harder, solve problems on their own, and feel more powerful.
