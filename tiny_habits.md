# Tiny Habits

## Question 1: Most Interesting Story or Idea (My View)

- For me, the most interesting idea was about "identity-based habits." I liked how the speaker said it's better to focus on who you want to become. For example, instead of saying “I want to be fit,” say “I am a healthy person.” I think this is powerful because when we believe something about ourselves, we act that way.

## Question 2: Using B = MAP to Build New Habits

- I find the B = MAP model really useful. It means:
  - **B** = Behavior  
  - **M** = Motivation  
  - **A** = Ability  
  - **P** = Prompt  

- To build good habits, I would:
  - Pick something I really care about (Motivation).
  - Make it super easy to start (Ability).
  - Set a reminder or link it to something I already do (Prompt), like after brushing teeth.

## Question 3: Why Celebrating is Important

- I truly believe celebrating small wins helps a lot. When I feel good after doing something right, I want to do it again. That feeling helps the habit stick. Even saying “Yes!” or doing a little dance can make a big difference.

## Question 4: Most Interesting Story or Idea (My View)

- What I liked most in this video is the idea of starting with tiny steps. For example, if I want to start exercising, I don’t need to do a full workout. Just putting on shoes or doing one push-up is enough to begin. This makes starting easier, and I’m more likely to keep going.

## Question 5: Book’s View on Identity (My Understanding)

- The book says that real habit change starts when we change how we see ourselves. I think that’s very true. If I see myself as a writer, I will write more. So, building identity helps to keep doing good things again and again.

## Question 6: How to Make a Habit Easier (What I Would Do)

- I would:
  - Start small, like just 2 minutes.
  - Keep things ready (like water near my study table).
  - Remove any distractions.
  - Use habits I already do as triggers (like reading after lunch).

## Question 7: How to Make a Bad Habit Harder

- To stop a bad habit, I would:
  - Hide anything that reminds me of it.
  - Make it take more time, like logging out of the app.
  - Tell myself why this habit is not good for me.
  - Make it boring, so I don’t feel like doing it.

## Question 8: Habit I Want to Do More

**Habit**: I want to read books every day.

**Steps I will follow**:
- Keep my book on my pillow.
- Read just one page at night.
- Read something fun or interesting.
- Smile and feel good after reading.

## Question 9: Habit I Want to Do Less

**Habit**: Using my phone for too long.

**Steps I will take**:
- Turn off app notifications.
- Move distracting apps to a hidden folder.
- Set screen time limits.
- Remind myself how much time I waste on it.
